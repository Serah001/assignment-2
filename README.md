How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
Branching allows developers to create separate versions of a project without affecting the main codebase. It enables parallel development, feature testing, and safe collaboration.

Typical Branching Workflow:
Create a Branch ‚Äì git branch feature-branch
Switch to Branch ‚Äì git checkout feature-branch (or git switch feature-branch)
Make Changes & Commit ‚Äì Modify files, then git add . and git commit -m "Added new feature"
Push to GitHub ‚Äì git push origin feature-branch
Create a Pull Request (PR) ‚Äì Merge changes via GitHub
Merge into Main Branch ‚Äì git merge feature-branch (or via PR)
Delete Branch (Optional) ‚Äì git branch -d feature-branch
Why Branching Matters?
‚úÖ Allows multiple developers to work simultaneously
‚úÖ Prevents breaking the main code
‚úÖ Supports testing & bug fixes safely
‚úÖ Improves workflow efficiency

Branching ensures smooth collaboration and version control in GitHub projects! üöÄ


Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
